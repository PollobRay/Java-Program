									Overloading methods
								>>-----------------------<<
			*	If two methods of a class (whether both declared in the same class, or both inherited by
					a class, or one declared and one inherited )
					have the same name but signatures that are not same, then the method name is
					said to be overloaded.
			*	method overloading is a way to implement polymorphism.
